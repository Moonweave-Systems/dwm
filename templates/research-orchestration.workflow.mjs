// Keelplane reusable template: research / design orchestration.
//
// Proven pattern (figure-agent "Illustrator Hand" dogfood, n=1 win):
//   Scope -> fan-out research -> BARRIER synthesis -> adversarial-verify-AGAINST-SOURCE -> compose doc
//
// Why this exists: turning a Keelplane blueprint into a runnable Workflow script
// was hand-coded each time and broke twice on JS parse errors. This template is
// syntax-validated and parameterized ENTIRELY through `args` -- you should not
// need to edit the JS. Run it with:
//
//   Workflow({ scriptPath: ".../templates/research-orchestration.workflow.mjs",
//              args: {
//                question: "the research/design question",          // REQUIRED
//                sources:  [ "path/to/source.py", "docs/spec.md" ], // REQUIRED ground truth to verify against
//                angles:   [ { key: "perf", prompt: "..." } ],      // OPTIONAL; derived from `question` if omitted
//                outPath:  "where/to/write/design-doc.md",          // OPTIONAL; doc is also returned
//                docKind:  "design document",                       // OPTIONAL label for the final artifact
//                verifyBatchSize: 8 } })                            // OPTIONAL; claims per verifier (default 8)
//
// The script RETURNS { doc, confirmed, partial, refuted, unverified, uncovered, claimCount, angles }.
// The caller (you, the orchestrator) writes `doc` to `args.outPath` if set --
// keeping the workflow pure keeps it resumable and cacheable.
//
// Runtime requirement: the verify phase reads `args.sources` directly, so the
// workflow subagent must have read access to them (Read/Grep for local files,
// WebFetch for urls). Pass sources the agents can actually open.
//
// Enforcement note: the verification discipline is enforced in CODE where it
// matters -- a "confirmed"/"partially-supported" verdict with no evidence locator
// is downgraded to "unverified"; verdicts for claim ids that were never in the
// draft are dropped; duplicate verdicts are deduped (most-conservative wins). What
// stays prompt-enforced (a known limit): whether the final prose silently reuses a
// refuted claim's substance -- the composer is instructed not to, but that is not
// machine-checked.

separate surface or perspective a worker can investigate without coordinating with
the others. Avoid angles that just restate the question. Return the angles only.`

Return discrete, CHECKABLE claims -- each a single factual statement another agent
could later confirm or refute against a source. Do not pad with generalities.
For every claim give a source_hint pointing at where it could be verified.
Do NOT label anything "verified" or "confirmed" -- that is a later phase's job.`

Produce a coherent draft ${docKind}: ordered sections that answer the question,
referencing claims by id. Then produce a flat \`claims\` list of every checkable claim
the draft relies on. Rules for the claims list:
- Each claim id MUST be unique across the whole draft.
- Set origin_angle to the angle the claim came from.
- Merge duplicate claims from different angles into ONE id (keep the clearest
  statement + a source_hint).
- Do NOT invent claims that no worker reported.
Carry forward unresolved tensions as open_questions.`

${sourceList}

CLAIMS (JSON):
${JSON.stringify(claimsChunk.map((c) => ({ id: c.id, statement: c.statement, source_hint: c.source_hint })), null, 2)}

Rules:
- Verify against GROUND TRUTH, not against the producer's reasoning. Open the actual
  source/data/artifact yourself, read the relevant part, and cite it in evidence
  (locator = file:line / key / url you ACTUALLY read; excerpt_or_value = the exact
  text or number found there). The source_hint is the producer's guess -- do not
  trust it; confirm by reading.
- Any "verified"/"confirmed" wording attached to a claim is itself a claim to refute,
  not a fact.
- Verdicts:
  - "confirmed": you read a source whose content fully supports the claim. REQUIRES
    a real evidence locator + excerpt.
  - "partially-supported": the source supports only a NARROWER version (the claim is
    overstated, over-generalized, or right-in-part). REQUIRES evidence; in reason,
    state exactly which part is unsupported and the narrower version that holds.
  - "refuted": the ground truth contradicts the claim.
  - "unverified": no supplied source lets you check it (default when unsure or when
    no sources were supplied).
- A "confirmed" or "partially-supported" verdict WITHOUT a real evidence locator is
  invalid and will be downgraded to "unverified" -- so always cite.
- Return EXACTLY ONE verdict per claim, each carrying the matching claim_id. Do not
  merge, skip, invent, or relabel claim ids.`

${question}

DRAFT (sections + claims, JSON):
${JSON.stringify(draft, null, 2)}

VERIFICATION LEDGER (JSON: confirmed / partial / refuted / unverified / uncovered):
${JSON.stringify(ledger, null, 2)}

Write the final document in Markdown:
- Build the argument on CONFIRMED claims; cite each one's evidence locator inline.
- For PARTIALLY-SUPPORTED claims, assert ONLY the narrower supported version stated
  in the verdict's reason, and cite the locator. Never assert the overstated form.
- Treat REFUTED, UNVERIFIED, and UNCOVERED claims as NOT established: do not assert
  their content anywhere in the prose, even if it appears in the draft sections.
- Add a short "Unverified / open" section listing (i) refuted claims (with why),
  (ii) unverified claims, (iii) uncovered claims (ledger.uncovered -- no verdict
  because a verifier batch failed or skipped them; they were NOT checked), and
  (iv) open questions.
- End with a "Verification summary" line: counts of confirmed / partial / refuted /
  unverified / uncovered.
Return the Markdown document only -- no preamble.`
